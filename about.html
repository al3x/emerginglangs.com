    <h2 class="content-subhead">About Emerging Languages</h2>

    <p>
      Emerging Languages brings together programming language designers, implementors, and enthusiasts to showcase their latest work, fostering a vibrant exchange of ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our international speakers range from working programmers to academics to hobbyists, representing a variety of disciplines and experience levels. Some languages and projects we feature are in production today, while others are still in the conceptual stages or exist solely for their research value.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a packed day of provocative medium-length talks, we send attendees home with fresh tools and concepts that cast new light on the work of programming. 
    </p>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>
      Emerging Languages was held as for the first time in 2010. Space was generously provided by O'Reilly during their annual <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON</a> conference in Portland, Oregon. Our event was popular enough that O’Reilly agreed to make it a formal part of OSCON the following year.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2012 Emerging Languages joined up with the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> conference in St Louis. We're happily continuing on in conjunction with Strange Loop in 2013. Emerging Languages is held the day before Strange Loop as part of the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/preconf">preconference events</a>.
    </p>
