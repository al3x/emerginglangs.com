    <p>
      In 2010, Emerging Languages was held as for the first time as an informal "camp"-style event. Space was generously provided by O'Reilly during their annual <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON</a> conference. Our event was popular enough that O’Reilly agreed to make it a formal part of OSCON that year.
    </p>

    <p>
In 2012 Emerging Languages joined up with the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> conference in St Louis. We hope to make this year’s event our best yet.
    </p>

    <h2 class="content-subhead">Thanks</h2>

    <p>Appreciation is due to the following folks who have helped in various ways to make our event happen over the years: Brady Forrest, Alex Miller, Steve Jenson, Michael Fogus.
