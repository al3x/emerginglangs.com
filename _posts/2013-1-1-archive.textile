We were back at "Strange Loop":https://thestrangeloop.com/preconf once again in 2013. One speaker had to drop out, but we enjoyed a day of eleven strong presentations.

Videos (including slides) of all presentations are "available on InfoQ":http://www.infoq.com/conferences/strangeloop2013/. For a few months they'll only be available to Strange Loop attendees. Eventually they'll be made freely available to the public.
