In 2011, Emerging Languages was made "an official track at OSCON":http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/topic/653. We changed up the format and experimented with fewer, longer presentations at the request of some previous attendees. Ultimately, this format was not as popular and shorter talks returned the following year. We still enjoyed some great presentations, though!
