2012 saw Emerging Languages join forces with "Strange Loop":https://thestrangeloop.com/, a well-regarded annual conference in St. Louis that's been running since 2009. While we greatly appreciated O'Reilly generously hosting our first two years, Strange Loop proved to be a better fit for the majority of our attendees. With its emphasis on applied Computer Science across a variety of technologies and topics, Strange Loop bridges industry and academia in much the same way we hope Emerging Languages does.

Our format changed once again this year, adopting one day of medium-length talks (twelve in total). This format has proven to be the best balance of our previous attempts and we're sticking with it in 2013 and beyond.
